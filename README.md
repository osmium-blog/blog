# Highlights

### ðŸš€ Itâ€™s fast

- Fully leverage SSR/SSG to pre-render pages as much as possible
- Use Notionâ€™s private API to ensure data-fetching efficiency

### ðŸ˜Œ Itâ€™s easy

- Use only Notion and you got a fully functional blog
- Manage your blog and posts in familiar Notion way

### ðŸ¤– Itâ€™s smart

- Auto-build-and-deploy your blog without any manual commands (if you are using Vercel or Netlify)
- Once deployed, just write your blog and posts will automatically update thanks to ISR

# Quick Start

- In GitHub
  - [Fork this project](https://github.com/osmium-blog/osmium/fork)
- In Notion
  - Duplicate this [Notion Database](https://silentdepth.notion.site/ffa2e3ae717d4cb982281814bb6c0801), and share to web **(optional but recommended)**
  - In the newly created database, find **Config** and open it
  - Open the [Osmium configurator](https://osmium-blog.vercel.app/-/configurator), fill the form with your preferences and click the top-right button to copy your config
  - Back to the page **Config** in Notion, remove the content of the code block and paste your config into it
  - _(Optional)_ Change the icon of the **Config** page. You can choose whichever type you like, no matter emoji or icon or image. That will be the logo and favicon of you blog
- In [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=Osmium&utm_campaign=oss) **(recommended)** or other platform you choose to deploy to
  - If you use Vercel, create a new project and link to your Osmium fork, then set the following environment variables:
    - `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`: The ID of the Notion Database you just created, usually a 32-digit or 36-digit hex code. You can find it from the page link in the share menu of the page. If you find two IDs, use the first one
    - `NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN` _(optional, not recommended)_: If you decide not to share your database, you can make Osmium grabbing data privately with the token. You can find it after the name `token_v2` in your browser cookies
      - **Notes:** Notion token is only valid for 180 days. Donâ€™t forget to update it in Vercel project settings before expiry. Weâ€™ll probably switch to the Notion Public API to resolve this issue in the future. Also, images may not be properly displayed in this case
  - If you are not a Vercel user, just build and deploy your fork as a normal Next.js app with the environment variables described above
- You are all set! Would you star this project? ðŸŒŸ
